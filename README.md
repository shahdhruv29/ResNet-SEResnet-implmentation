# ResNet-SEResnet-implmentation

This repository contains the implementation of the ResNet-34 and the SE-ResNet-34 architecture from scratch from the paper titled [Deep Residual Learning For Image Recognition](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1512.03385) and [Squeeze And Excitation Networks](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1709.01507).
Here, I have used the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. 
I have also performed Transfer Learning on the pre-trained ResNet-34 model in pytorch on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
